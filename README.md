# 🧠 Automatic Text Summarization using Extractive and Abstractive Techniques

This project implements a hybrid text summarization system that combines both extractive and abstractive approaches. Extractive summarization selects key sentences using techniques like TextRank, K-Means, and Agglomerative Clustering. The selected sentences are then passed to transformer-based abstractive models (T5 and BART) to generate coherent and concise summaries.

## 📌 Abstract

With the rapid growth of digital content, extracting relevant information from large volumes of text has become a major challenge. This project proposes a hybrid approach for automatic text summarization. It uses extractive methods to identify the most relevant sentences from the source and then applies transformer-based models to paraphrase them into a human-readable summary. The use of Agglomerative Clustering and the BART model proved most effective in generating summaries with high ROUGE scores.

## 🔧 System Overview

1. **Preprocessing**  
   - Sentence segmentation, tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal

2. **Extractive Summarization**  
   - TF-IDF vectorization  
   - Cosine similarity matrix generation  
   - Sentence selection using TextRank, K-Means, or Agglomerative Clustering

3. **Abstractive Summarization**  
   - The extractive summary is passed into T5 or BART models  
   - Generates human-like rewritten summaries

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Summaries evaluated using ROUGE metrics (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L)  
   - Training and test loss tracked to monitor model performance
